## Compiling [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

chrome.sockets.tcp.xhr uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). If you haven't used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.

### Available Grunt commands

| Function  | Command       | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Build     | `grunt`       | Run `grunt` to run tests locally and compile. |
| Tests     | `grunt test`  | Runs tests.                                   |
| Watch     | `grunt watch` | This is a convenience method for watching.    |

### Troubleshooting dependencies

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, chrome.sockets.tcp.xhr is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**
